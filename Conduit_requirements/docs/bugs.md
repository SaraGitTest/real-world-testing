# Bugs

The following bugs will be addressed during the development and testing phases:

1.	By default, non-registered users are automatically following all registered users. 

2.	Once tags are created, registered users cannot edit them. 

3.	The page number format becomes incorrect when navigating beyond pages and returning to the previous page. Specifically, an ellipsis (...) is displayed between the pages where a number should be, which should not occur.

4.  If a registered user attempts to open multiple tabs, holding the 'Ctrl' key for each tab to display their own articles, the tabs open as if the user is unregistered.

5.  Typically, when signed in on one tab, it is expected that subsequent tabs should also open as signed in. However, in this scenario, the tabs open as if the user is unregistered
