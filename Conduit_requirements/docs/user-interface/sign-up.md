# Sign Up

- The ‘Sign Up’ page should display the following fields: ‘Username’, ‘Email’ and ‘Password’.

   ### 1. Registered Users

      If a registered user tries to sign up using either a username or email that is already registered, a message should appear that states the ‘user already exists’.

   ### 2. Unregistered Users

      An unregistered user should be able to sign up, granted that they provide the following:

      * A username that doesn’t already exist.
      * A valid email address consists of an email prefix and an email domain. The prefix appears to the left of the @ symbol. The domain appears to the right of the @ symbol.
      * A password consisting of at least 8 characters.
