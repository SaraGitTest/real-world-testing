# New Article

- The ‘New Article’ page should display the following fields: ‘Article Title’, ‘What’s this article about?’ (description),  ‘Write your article (in markdown)’ (body) and ‘Enter tags’ (tags)

   ### 1. Registered Users

      A registered user should be able to publish an article, granted that the input within the article title, description and body is 1 character(s) long. If they try to publish an article without these fields filled in, then an error message should display. Whilst tags are not mandatory, a registered user can include a tag by writing it within the textbox and pressing ‘Enter’. This in turn should cause the tag to appear below the textbox. 
      
      Once an article is published, it should appear within the 'Global Feed' and the 'My Articles' section of their user profile. In addition, if the registered user has added a tag which is unique, it should appear at the end of the ‘Popular Tags’ column.

   ### 2. Unregistered Users

      This option should not be available for unregistered users.
