# Navigation Bar

- Before a user is logged in, the navigation bar should display the following buttons: ‘Conduit’, ‘Home’, ‘Sign In’ and ‘Sign Up’.

   ### 1. Registered Users

      Once a registered user has logged into their account, the navigation bar should change. Instead, it should display the following buttons: ‘Conduit’, ‘Home’, ‘New Article’, ‘Settings’ and '< profile username >’.

   ### 2. Unregistered Users

      The navigation bar should not change for unregistered users.
