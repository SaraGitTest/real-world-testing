   ### 1. Registered Users
   
   In the article section, registered users possess the capability to not only view articles authored by other users but also to engage with them by posting comments, favouriting articles, following other users, and navigating to the users' profile by clicking on the userâ€™s profile link. They are empowered to manage their own articles, including editing the article, deleting the article, and posting comments. When users edit their own article, they are able to edit any section within the article apart from the tags.

   ### 2. Unregistered Users
   
   Conversely, non-registered users are limited to passive viewing of articles without the ability to interact or post comments, however, they can attempt to follow the author and favourite the article. Non-registered users are able to click on the user profile from the articles to view the user profile.
