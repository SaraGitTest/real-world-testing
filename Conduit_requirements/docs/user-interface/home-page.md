# Homepage

- When both registered and non-registered users navigate the homepage, they can browse all articles in the global feed, where clicking on the ‘read more’ link on an article allows users to read the full article. Users of both registered and non-registered can click on author names in the Global Feed to view their profiles and can filter articles by clicking on tags in the popular tags section. They also can favourite articles directly on the global feed page and view more articles from clicking on the navigation page number underneath the list of articles.

  ### 2.	Unregistered Users
