# Your Feed

- Once a user is logged in, the ‘Your Feed’ section should display previews of articles written by other users which they are following. Each preview should contain the username of the author, the profile picture of the author, the date of publication, the title of the article, the description of the article, a ‘Read more…’ link, an enabled love heart button, as well as any tags relating to that article.

   ### 1. Registered Users

      A registered should be able to view the profile of another user by clicking on their username. Furthermore, by clicking on the ‘Read more…’ more within a preview, they should be redirected onto a page that lets them view the entire article. In addition to this, they should be able to favourite an article by clicking on the love heart icon adjacent to it. The counter within this icon should also be incremented by 1.

   ### 2. Unregistered Users

      This option should not be available for unregistered users.
